### Day 1: Feb 15, 2017

### Day 2: Feb 16, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Digesting JS closure and it's rules and bugs as well

**Thoughts:** Some concepts and examples took me a while to understand, but to remember those and use it practically might be a lot more of effort. Need to read more about JS next days.

### Day 4: Feb 18, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Callback reading. Bucket list app with Python Flask.

**Thoughts:** 
* Learn & re-learn alot of important cool stuffs about JavaScript callback functions
* While creating bucket list app
	* Now trying to talk with db without sqlalchemy
	* Using db cursor, might help to understand more about db connection

### Day 5: Feb 19, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JS "this" reading. Continue with my bucket list.

**Thoughts:** No thought yet, trying to see how can I practice using "this" since it would be extremely useful to use it properly.

##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continue with my bucket list: add item and show them all

### Day 7: Feb 22, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continue with my bucket list.

**Thoughts:** After 1 day break, I continue with my bucketlist after a very busy day. Basically it's just to add function for open item detail in a form, edit form and update detail to database. Again, no js reading done today.... Tomorrow will be another busy day!

### Day 7: Feb 23, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Doing my front end form

**Thoughts:** Long day with around 10+ hours of working so I'll cheat a little bit by taking those hours to my 8th day of 100 days of code

### Day 8: Feb 24, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continue with my bucket list.

**Thoughts:** #TGIF! I'm just adding the delete function to the bucket list. Seems like `delete` is the keyword or reserved word in JS so I cant call it until I rename it lol
