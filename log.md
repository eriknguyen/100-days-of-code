# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 03, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started github page with a basic single-page portfolio

**Thoughts:** I spent around 2 hours for this and I think this can be improved. This is a very simple page since I haven't got any idea how I should design my page and I don't have much information to put as well. It's at least a good start for the challenge though.

### Day 2: Jan 04, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed scrolling bug on Safari. But failed to fix the same one on iOS Chrome.

**Thoughts**: I think I've spent too much time trying non-sense options without digging deep to the problem. A failed day or a tried-hard day.
