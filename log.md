# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 03, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started github page with a basic single-page portfolio

**Thoughts:** I spent around 2 hours for this and I think this can be improved. This is a very simple page since I haven't got any idea how I should design my page and I don't have much information to put as well. It's at least a good start for the challenge though.

### Day 2: Jan 04, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed scrolling bug on Safari. But failed to fix the same one on iOS Chrome.

**Thoughts**: I think I've spent too much time trying non-sense options without digging deep to the problem. A failed day or a tried-hard day.

### Day 3: Jan 05, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Joined Javascript30 Challenge to refresh vanilla JS foundation. Finished day 1.

**Thoughts**: Simple exercise to start new challenge and to relax but still building coding habit. Practised some ES6 (back text, template string, arrow function), browser events and sound element.

### Day 4: Jan 06, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Javascript30 Day 2: build an analog clock.

### Day 5: Jan 08, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Javascript30 Day 3: Practise CSS variables and

### Day 5: Jan 09, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Javascript30 Day 4+5: JS Array Cardio + Created Flex Panel Gallery

**Thoughts**: 
1. JS Array Cardio: Learnt many useful stuffs: filter, map, sort, reduce... I wonder how fast I would implement all my function with these. Don't know why I have always been doing it the long way.

2. Flex Panel Gallery: Used flexbox to build a flex panel gallery. I've never used flexbox before as well and may consider to start playing with it since it's very useful and hopefully it will be fully supported by Edge in near future.

### Day 6: Jan 10, 2017
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Javascript30 Day 6: JS Input Auto Suggestion

**Thoughts**: Learnt a few new ES6 stuffs today which includes: fetch, promise, funny syntax of spread function (...) and continues practising some useful stuffs like JS regex, back text, and array methods. Well, the more I learnt the more stupid I feel and the bigger and more interesting JS world I can see. Need to work harder to be better at this language.
