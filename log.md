# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 03, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started github page with a basic single-page portfolio

**Thoughts:** I spent around 2 hours for this and I think this can be improved. This is a very simple page since I haven't got any idea how I should design my page and I don't have much information to put as well. It's at least a good start for the challenge though.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
